# Convolutional-Neural-Network

 The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been used to obtain state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks such as object detection image segmentation, and generating photo-realistic images of people and things that don't exist in the real world!

 We will explore the fundamentals of convolution and why it's useful for deep learning and even NLP (natural language processing).

 We use modern techniques such as data augmentation and batch normalization, and build modern architectures such as VGG.

 We explore: 

    - The basics of machine learning and neurons 

    - Neural networks for classification and regression 

    - How to model image data in code

    - How to model text data for NLP 

    - How to build an CNN using Tensorflow 2

    - How to use batch normalization and dropout  regularization in Tensorflow 2

    - How to do image classification in Tensorflow 2

    - How to do data preprocessing for your own custom image dataset

    - How to use Embeddings in Tensorflow 2 for NLP

    - How to build a Text Classification CNN for NLP (examples: spam detection, sentiment analysis, parts-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition)
